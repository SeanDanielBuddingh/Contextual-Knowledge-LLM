The prisoner was sure this was his brother who had become a judge because of
Each sentence should be a complete thought. The old woman who lived in the same house as Jean Valjean was very curious and liked to snoop on others because she was jealous of their lives. She was a little hard of hearing, which made her talk a lot, and she only had two teeth left, which made a clicking sound when she spoke. She had tried to ask Cosette questions, but Cosette didn't know anything about Jean Valjean's past. One day, the
. Here is the simplified explanation: The popularity of deep learning has grown a lot in science and industry but its fundamental understanding is still limited, so this thesis aims to develop a theory of deep learning by focusing on the concepts of rank, generalization and expressiveness, and it shows that training neural networks can lead to low rank and this can help explain how they work well with natural data like audio, images and text, and it also explores how graph neural networks can model interactions using a concept of rank
.Here's a simplified explanation: Genetic variants are tiny differences in our DNA that can cause diseases, and doctors need to find and understand these differences to help patients. With new technology, there's now a huge amount of data about these genetic variants, but it's hard for doctors to make sense of it all. To solve this problem, scientists have created special computer programs called genomic foundation models, but these programs need to be tested to see how well they work. The question is, can these programs
